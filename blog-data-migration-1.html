                            <p>The core of every organization is data. Either new or old, organizations look for means
                                to keep the data in consolidated databases and servers. This can be done by successful
                                data migration.
                                According to Gartner reports, about 80% of projects on data migration do not measure up
                                to standard and takes money and time. Although a possible risk, migration of data is
                                unavoidable. The great news about this is that these risks can be reduced if some norms
                                are observed. To start with, let us understand what data migration is all about.
                                What are data migration and data migration testing?
                                The process of transferring data from one system to another is known as data migration.
                                This is primarily used when an organization intends to transfer the information to
                                another database, merging the system, upgrades to another OS, or scaling up to
                                data-intensive applications. Data migration can result in the improvement of various
                                performances prompting quicker transactions. The process can be categorized into 6
                                significant types:

                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <p> ● Storage Migration: Data migration happens from old storage system to new <br>
                                ● Business Process Migration: Migration of different methods feasible for the business
                                happens inside computing environments. <br>
                                ● Database Migration: Data migration to upgraded platform <br>
                                ● Application Migration: An application, is completely migrated from one platform to the
                                other for scalability and better performance.<br>
                                ● Cloud Migration: Migration of any process, data, or application to a computing
                                platform that is cloud-based <br>
                                ● Operating system Migration: Migration including a change in Operating systems such as
                                MAC, Windows, Linux based for performance and virtualization purposes
                                On the contrary, data migration testing is the process to confirm if the migrated data
                                match the original and is error-free. Failure in the migration of data can result in the
                                loss of sensitive information, resulting in the breakdown of applications/systems and
                                the repercussions of business setbacks. This can be avoided by end-to-end data migration
                                testing. The testing plays a critical part as well in detecting all the possible risks
                                ahead of time.

                                The data utilized for testing contains both old data as well as new data sets.
                                Consistent testing must be done for legacy applications as well as the new applications
                                till it stabilizes. <br>
                                ● Data migration aims to move the data to another place with the highest accuracy and
                                minimum downtime.<br>
                                ● Identifying the testing environment, as well as the right tools for migration, are key
                                determining factors for an effective migration<br>
                                ● It is important to verify whether functional and the non-functional aspects are met
                                immediately upon completion of the migration without any modifications in data
                                integrity.<br>
                                ● Any type of glitches should be eliminated after the testing and must be fixed<br>
                                ● Data migration testing likewise ensures that all the connections stay intact with the
                                required data inflow<br>

                                There are three stages of the data migration process: <br>
                                1. Pre Migration phase: It has to do with the scope, analysis of needs, dependencies as
                                well as planning. Creation of rigorous testing scenarios is made. The plan matches the
                                requirements of the project and business as a whole as well as technology. The schema of
                                a new application is made. The number of records and tables are recorded which can be
                                calculated once the migration is done. The interface of the new application is carefully
                                studied. <br>
                                2. In-Migration phase, the plan is performed with procedures that are customized. <br>
                                3. The Post Migration phase ends the migration after the important data verification as
                                regards completeness, compatibility as well as functionality. The records count,
                                schemas, and tables are verified. Redundancies are removed. Cases of mismatching,
                                integrity, and modified formats are as well verified. This comes after step by step
                                documentation and reports of version control, summing up a pass or fail result for every
                                scenario, downtime summary, test logs, functionality, data leaks as well as other
                                important details. <br>
                                <br>
                                Thus, data migration lifecycle includes a thorough assessment of requirements and an
                                end-to-end planning. Then a fool-proof strategy-building method with a viable POC is
                                created. With the generation of automatic data migration test scripts, test scenarios
                                are created. With the final execution, the test environment is set up. Defect analysis
                                is assessed and defects are reduced and fixed with the generation of comprehensive end
                                reports. The migrated data application is ready for going live or for the use of
                                production.
                                Common practices that should be followed: <br>
                                ● Make the stakeholders active in the planning stage and map out the needs clearly
                                taking every aspect into consideration. <br>
                                ● Ensure the team prepares well with the migration tool beforehand explaining all the
                                procedures to them well ahead of time.<br>
                                ● The team should be familiar with the scripts and the back-end tech which will be used
                                for the migration. <br>
                                ● Business risk analyst, owners, test engineers as well as architects of the products
                                must be active in getting all scenarios and considering risks from every aspect. <br>
                                ● Give an in-depth report of the number of selected testings, testing approach, the
                                ability of the group and experience, the procedure selected, and the likes and make it
                                verified by the stockholders. <br><br>

                                Tips for Data Migration<br>
                                ● Try dummy data transfer to test migration tool to be sure of its efficiency. This will
                                help in planning effectively giving you the general idea of the work like the amount of
                                data that should be transferred per session or if there is a need for any
                                adjustments.<br>
                                ● Take a load balance testing to ensure the legacy data and the migrated one are
                                synchronized.<br>
                                ● Ensure beforehand that you have the right data mapping to verify that the migration is
                                successful.<br>
                                ● This should be followed by checking the validity of the data and functional testing.
                                The current application should be able to make the same features as the legacy in the
                                same or decreased turnaround time.<br>
                                ● Have a backup ready every time in case the migration is not successful.<br>
                                ● In a situation where the migration is not successful at any time, rollback testing
                                ensures that the functions performed by the legacy system are not affected in any
                                way.<br>
                                ● Regression test and backward compatibility test provide further checks.<br><br>
                                Benefits of data migration testing<br>
                                ● ROI improvement<br>
                                ● Easy scalability<br>
                                ● Backup methodology<br>
                                ● Enhance data integration<br>
                                ● Legacy system relevant with a new tech stack<br>
                                ● Promoting efficiency<br> <br>
                                Cons of data migration testing<br>
                                ● Compatibility problems<br>
                                ● Investment in training<br>
                                ● Data Leaks<br>
                                ● A longer downtime, which leads to loss<br>
                                ● Compromised Security <br>
                                Most times, data migration leads to leaks, issues in transferring data that is large,
                                irregularities in data, and quality reduction. It is a time-consuming and costly
                                process. Over 70% of organizations are still afraid of the data migration process and
                                reluctant to do it. Nonetheless, the task can be enhanced by end-to-end testing, after
                                the data is organized and cleaned.
