                            <p>Seems more like a fantasy, right? In a bid to cut costs of automated tools, a large
                                number of companies purchase a variety of tools used to carry out tests on multiple
                                Operating systems and multiple environments. This causes a tricky scenario where
                                management is very difficult. Another obstacle that has to be overcome in the training
                                of the engineers who perform the tests. Imagine a single platform that can perform all
                                the tests; it would smoothen the testing process and also reduce the costs of testing.
                                Now, before discussing in more detail this magic tool, we have to discuss what we mean
                                by multiple environments and Operating system testing, the merits, as well as the
                                demerits.

                            <p>What do we mean by multiple operating system testing?<br>

                                In a case where you develop an application on your operating system, like a Windows
                                variation. As soon as the software is all good and ready to be sold off, you have to
                                have knowledge of the most common types of operating systems available to the public. In
                                what way can you make sure that your software works perfectly on systems using a
                                different operating system? This testing, i.e. Multi operating system testing makes sure
                                that this kind of problem is not even an issue. Because of this testing, your system
                                works perfectly the way you want it despite working on varying Operating systems. All
                                new creations have their own difficult issues. Parameters like security patches,
                                customization facility, stability, and connectivity support differ with the varying
                                operating systems. Tests need to be carried out on these operating systems if the
                                software you created is also in the mobile domain because of the speed of increase of
                                mobile applications. Mobile testing takes care of this very well and has its own
                                versions for iOS and Android iOS.

                                Facts you may not know<br>

                                Windows has about 77.7% of the market share for operating systems used on desktops alone
                                and MAC OS x portion of the market share is just about 17.04%, says Statista. The most
                                shocking fact is that among the top 500 of the world’s most powerful supercomputers,
                                Linux is the most popular Operating system. <br><br>


                                You can make an argument that we can have various systems with varying operating systems
                                each, on which we can make tests, however, because the testers have to test each program
                                after reaching out to each of the systems, it becomes a load of work which is actually
                                not necessary in any way. In scenarios like this, the virtual machine becomes very
                                useful because it makes it easier to have multiple operating systems in a single
                                framework. <br><br>

                                The challenge now is to discover an automated testing tool that can be used to perform
                                tests that work perfectly with all operating systems at hand in order to begin the
                                testing process with the minimal but successful creation of test cases. <br><br>

                                Meaning of multiple environment testing<br>
                                The main aim of development is to create a dependable software application that in
                                changing times will remain applicable to the glitch-free flow. Develops tools to make
                                the process updated and cohesive. If multiple environments are checked right from the
                                development phase, the whole team profits, helping them to work alongside each other as
                                a unit with well-defined goals. As soon as the deployed code becomes stable, the staging
                                environment comes into focus in which there is a certainty of good quality by QA teams
                                making upgrades and making notes of any bugs that may exist so they can be tackled. Then
                                the next stage is the deployment phase of the environment setup. Different environment
                                setups depend on the demands of the project in line with the needs of the end-user.
                                However, generally, there are 3 simple levels to which it is divided. <br><br>

                                Development<br>
                                All the in-depth and solution-creating thinking, brainstorming is done here and as such,
                                this is where the actual work starts. In this stage, work like bringing your concept
                                into actuality glimpses that have code which has an infinite number of commits and also
                                merges happen in this phase. In a bid to retain the original database, a dummy database
                                is created and used to form the code. Unit testing is used continuously to debug
                                parallelly, by the developers who make the core logic adding features.<br><br>

                                Stage<br>
                                At this point, the code is in the system of the developers and also in servers that are
                                ready to be tested rigidly so as to discover the weak links in the code. This stage is
                                very important as it determines how the code will look like and makes sure the software
                                is running glitch-free. Creating test scenarios with all possible outcomes, validation
                                of their execution, also with configuration update changes. Also available are some QA
                                Environments used for integration testing, end-to-end testing, functional testing, load
                                testing.<br><br>


                                Production<br>
                                In this last phase, the go-live environment is the prime focus. It is a vital portion of
                                every environment as the consumers or clients have access to this part only and as such,
                                the accomplishment of the venture is determined here. The former stages ensure that at
                                this stage, there is no harmful bug in order to maintain a good market image. Making

                                developers, decision-makers, business analysts. The advantage of this is that the output
